# Solution

Please see the attached solution and consider the following:
1. My approach was to combine namespacing feature of i18next with the lazy loading of locales. This way it's not even necessary to load any language strings in advance of components. In addition reactivity for loading states & language change are managed in a convenient hook.
2. I'd decided to make the least possible footprint on the codebase, not installing any new dependencies, rather implementing some stuff manually when, say `i18nextreact` library could save me some lines of code. This is what I understand you'd rather see as well. So I used i18next events to help manage reactivity.
3. I'd added a slightly more complexed namespacing logic for Components' locales: '<Container>.<Component>', but it works with just '<Component>' as well.

Installation instructions follow.

# Install

1. run **npm install**
2. run **npm start**

# Intro

The given application is using the library i18next to support Internationalization.
It is storing all the components strings in a single file for each language under the "/public/locales" folder.

For this simple example app we are supporting en-US only and the only components that support Internationalization are the following:

1. DetailsView
2. ResourcesFilter
3. ResourcesHeader

**Those are the only components that you should implement the solution on. Feel free to change/refactor them if needed**

# The Problem

The current solution is not scalable and doesnâ€™t allow us to completely separate our components from each other in order to support code-splitting in the future (Co-location).

# Your Exercise

1. Provide a solution to our problem by allowing each component to define its own strings and lazy load them only when first rendered.
2. Add a language switch button to the top header and add support to the Spanish langauage.


Make sure that your solution is **scalable & reusable**.

##### For example

The directory "/containers/ResourcesContainer/components/ResourcesHeader" should have a "./locales/en-US/strings.json" file that will include the following strings:

```json
{
  "TITLE": "My Resources",
  "SUBTITLE": "Resources List"
}
```

**Note:** Make sure you remove the prefix of the component name from the string keys.
meaning, **RESOURCES_HEADER_TITLE** turns into **TITLE**
