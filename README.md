# Install

1. run **npm install**
2. run **npm start**

# Intro

The given application is using the library i18next to support Internationalization.
It is storing all the components strings in a single file for each language under the "/public/locales" folder.

For this simple example app we are supporting en-US only and the only components that support Internationalization are the following:

1. DetailsView
2. ResourcesFilter
3. ResourcesHeader

**Those are the only components that you should implement the solution on. Feel free to change/refactor them if needed**

# The Problem

The current solution is not scalable and doesnâ€™t allow us to completely separate our components from each other in order to support code-splitting in the future (Co-location).

# Your Exercise

1. Provide a solution to our problem by allowing each component to define its own strings and lazy load them only when first rendered.
2. Add a language switch button to the top header and add support to the Spanish langauage.


Make sure that your solution is **scalable & reusable**.

##### For example

The directory "/containers/ResourcesContainer/components/ResourcesHeader" should have a "./locales/en-US/strings.json" file that will include the following strings:

```json
{
  "TITLE": "My Resources",
  "SUBTITLE": "Resources List"
}
```

**Note:** Make sure you remove the prefix of the component name from the string keys.
meaning, **RESOURCES_HEADER_TITLE** turns into **TITLE**

# Solution Submission

The code should be placed in an open GitHub repository.
